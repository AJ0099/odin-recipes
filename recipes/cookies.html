    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup butter or margarine, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>¼ cup molasses</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set 2 tablespoons
        sugar in a small bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift together flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in
        a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat butter and remaining 1 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric
        mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, then stir in molasses and
        water. Gradually stir the sifted ingredients into the molasses mixture
        until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use floured hands to shape dough into 24 walnut-sized balls. Roll each
        ball in the reserved sugar until coated. Place cookies 2 inches apart
        onto ungreased cookie sheets, and flatten slightly with the bottom of a
        glass.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway
        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for
        5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
